    <p>Hello, my name is Daniel. Throughout my childhood I have always been in love with creating artowrk. It was and has been my favourite subject in school for as long as I can remember. When the time came to start thinking about possible career paths, I thought about the subjects I enjoyed most in school and how they could translate into work. Graphic design was one of those career paths that came to mind so here I am now, persuing this career and enjoying the experience, the ups, and the downs along the way. I have included in the website some of my personal favourite artwork that I have created for my portfolio so far in my early journey down the graphic design path.</p>

      <p>When Looking for a graphic design job creating a well put together portfoilo is one of the more important things to have. It shows what you are capible of in terms of using the different programs and it shows your creativity at coming up with unique ideas for different types of projects. It's good to include a wide range of work from magazine layouts to logo designs and motion graphic work even if you aren't nessesarily going to be working in those areas so you can show you are versatile. </p>
