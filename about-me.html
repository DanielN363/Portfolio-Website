      <p>Hello, my name is Daniel. Throughout my childhood I have always been in love with creating artowrk. It was and has been my favourite subject in school for as long as I can remember. When the time came to start thinking about possible career paths, I thought about the subjects I enjoyed most in school and how they could translate into work.</p>
      <p>Graphic design was one of those career paths that came to mind so here I am now, persuing this career and enjoying the experience, the ups, and the downs along the way. I have included in the website some of my personal favourite artwork that I have created for my portfolio so far in my early journey down the graphic design path.</p>
